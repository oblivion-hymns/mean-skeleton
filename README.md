# MEAN Skeleton Application
Simple skeleton application to quickly get developers up and running with the MEAN stack.

## Prep
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `sudo npm install -g supervisor` to install supervisor globally

## Instructions
- `npm start` to start the server
- `npm run build` to watch client-side files for changes

Once both are running, you should not have to touch them unless there is a fatal error.

## Included packages
- Angular Material & all associated packages
- Supervisor (so you don't have to restart the server when you change files)
- Webpack
